Loose couping enables you to write code which is [open for extensibility, but closed for modification]. This is called the OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE.
The only place where you need to modify the code is at the application's entry point; we call this the COMPOSITION ROOT.

Three dimensions of DI:
Object composition
Object lifetime
Interception

Three ways for configuring DI Containers
1) Configuring containers with XML
2£©Configuring containers with Code
3) Configuring containers by convention

DI Container patterns:
1) Composition Root:
where should we compose object graphs?
As Close As Possible to the application's Entry point.
DEFINITION: 
A Composition Root is a unique location in an application where modules are composed together.
TIP: 
The composition Root can be spread out across multiple classes as long as they all reside in a single module.
2)Register Resolve Release
How should we use a DI Container?
By following the strict register resolve release method call sequence.
